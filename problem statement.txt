Objective: 
To develop a Q&A bot for the given dataset. Fine-tuning an open-source Language 
Model (LLM) or integrate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique with an LLM. 
The complete code should be capable of running locally on a laptop or on any open-source 
cloud platform (free for students). 
Requirements: 
1. Dataset: The dataset of 6 pdf documents can be found at the link. 
2. Coding language: Python 
3. Libraries: You are free to use any open-source libraries or frameworks you find 
suitable for this task. 
4. Model Architecture: Utilize open-source pre-trained language model architecture. 
However, you must do either of the following: 
• Fine-tune the model on the provided dataset. 
• Include RAG technique in the pipeline. 
5. Optimization: Perform memory optimization techniques to be able to run locally or on 
a cloud platform. 
6. Evaluation metric: For additional points, consider implementing an appropriate 
evaluation metric. Manually verify the accuracy of the responses by generating and 
validating a diverse set of questions derived from the provided PDF documents in the 
dataset.
